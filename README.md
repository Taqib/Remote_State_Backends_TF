###Remote State, Remote Backends with Terraform Cloud and State commands

In Terraform, the state file is crucial as it maps Terraform configurations to real-world infrastructure. By default, this state file is stored locally in the terraform.tfstate file. While local state storage is convenient for individual projects, it doesn't scale well for team collaboration due to issues like state file corruption, lack of state locking, and the risk of exposing sensitive information. To address these challenges, Terraform allows you to store state remotely using remote backends, like S3 or Terraform Cloud, which offer secure, shared storage and state locking.

In this lab, we'll explore how to configure and use Terraform Cloud as a remote backend for your Terraform state file. You'll learn how to securely manage your infrastructure state, enabling collaboration while protecting sensitive data.


###Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:

--AWS Configuration: Use aws configure command to configure AWS.
--Terraform Cloud Account: Set up a free Terraform Cloud account.
--Create organization and workspace: In terraform cloud account create an organization and workspace if you don't have any.

###Task

You are part of a DevOps team tasked with managing the infrastructure for a new application. The application requires a VPC with a subnet. You need to configure Terraform Cloud as the remote backend for managing this infrastructure. The state file should be stored securely, with the ability to lock the state during updates to avoid conflicts. The configuration should be managed in a way that allows other team members to collaborate without risking state file corruption or exposing sensitive information.
